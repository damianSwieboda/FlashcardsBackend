## Note to recruiters
This repository is my coding playground, where I explore and mix GraphQL and HTTP requests with NestJS - I undrestand using both of them simultaneously in the project is not the best approach from development perspective. While it's currently a learning space, I am serious about launching this app commercially in the future. I'm aware of my current gaps, but I see this project as both a recruitment showcase and a stepping stone in creating a cross-platform app based on NestJS and a monorepo of React and React Native for the frontend. This serves as a sketch or scaffolding for the long-term project that I will develop as an experienced developer

Thank you for checking it out!

Best regards,
Damian

## One liner
This project is dedicated to offering users a seamless and efficient language learning platform. by integrating the finest features from industry-leading language apps, and introducing niche learning methods not yet digitalized by them.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Running the tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Features
Currently, the only functionalities of the application consist of authorization, authentication, creating sets, cards and adding translations.

## Sets and Cards logic
- They are two pools of cards - official cards, and cards created by users
- Official Sets contains only official cards
- User Sets contains User Cards and also official cards
- Official Sets, and User Sets differ from Learning Sets - becouse user can choose if he wants to add entire set to learn, or choosen cards. More about it in [Adding sets and cards to learning stack](#adding-sets-and-cards-to-learning-stack)

## Translations of cards logic
Your readme section provides a clear explanation of the structure and advantages of the translation property in your cards. However, there are a couple of minor edits for clarity and readability:

"Every card contains a 'translations' property, which comprises an array of objects. Each object represents a language translation of the card in which it is located. There is no single main word to translate; instead, multiple translations are grouped by meaning and common definitions.

The advantage of this approach is the easy and fast creation of translations for multiple languages. For instance, if a card has two translations, such as Polish and English, it is useful for two types of customers: those who use Polish and want to learn English, and vice versa.
However, adding one more translation, let's say Spanish, increases its utility for six types of customers.
```bash
polish customer can learn: english(1) and spanish(2)
english customer can learn: polish(3) and spanish(4)
spanish customer can learn: english(5) and polish(6)
```

With each additional translation, the number of language pairs is expanding exponentially. Example after adding french translation:
```bash
polish customer can learn: english(1), spanish(2) and french(3)
english customer can learn: polish(4), spanish(5)  and french(6)
spanish customer can learn: english(7), polish(8) and french(9)
french customer can learn: polish(10), spanish(11) and english(12)
```
